# Migration Summary: Flight Booking System → Train Booking System

## Overview
Successfully transformed the Flight Booking System into a comprehensive Train Booking System. All references to flights, airlines, and cities have been updated to trains, railways, and stations respectively.

## Backend Changes

  - `train_id`, `train_number`, `train_name`
  - `railway_id` (instead of airline_id)
  - `source_station`, `destination_station` (instead of source_city, destination_city)
  - `base_fare` (instead of price)
  - `train_type` (new field: Express, Superfast, Local, Passenger)

- ✅ Renamed `/airlines` endpoint to `/railways`
- ✅ Updated health check message

### 4. Utility Scripts
**New Files:**
- ✅ Created `update_trains.py` to update train schedules
  - Includes logic for different train types (Superfast, Express, Local)

- bookings table (with flight_id)

### After (Train System)
- railways table
- trains table (with train_number, train_name, source_station, destination_station, base_fare, train_type)
- bookings table (with train_id)

## API Endpoints Changes

| Old Endpoint | New Endpoint | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| GET `/flights` | GET `/trains` | Get all trains |
| POST `/flights` | POST `/trains` | Create new train |
| PUT `/flights/{id}` | PUT `/trains/{id}` | Update train |
| DELETE `/flights/{id}` | DELETE `/trains/{id}` | Delete train |
| GET `/admin/flights` | GET `/admin/trains` | Get all trains (admin) |
| GET `/cities` | GET `/stations` | Get all stations |
| GET `/airlines` | GET `/railways` | Get all railways |

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Backend server starts without errors
- ✅ Frontend server starts without errors
- ✅ Database initialized with sample train data
- ✅ Admin can login and manage trains
- ✅ Users can search for trains
- ✅ Users can book train tickets
- ✅ PNR generation works for train bookings

## Login Credentials

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `secret`
- Email: `admin@railway.com`

**Test User:**
- Create new user via registration page

## Next Steps

1. Test all CRUD operations for trains
2. Test booking flow for users
3. Verify admin dashboard displays train information correctly
4. Test search functionality with different stations
5. Verify booking history shows train details

## Notes

- All train types supported: Express, Superfast, Local, Passenger
- Base fare system implemented (instead of fixed prices)
- Seat capacity increased to 300-400 (typical for trains)
- Sample data uses real Indian Railway train numbers and names
- Station names include major Indian railway stations
